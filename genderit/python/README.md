Welcome to the gender-it tools for python.

This subfolder contains instruction and examples to download, install and use the tool.

The content can be downloaded from: https://ies-r4r-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wgnd/dta/genderit_python.zip; or from the Jupyter notebook: 'download gender_it.ipynb'

The different functions can be found in the package: 'gender_it_functions.py'.

The three dictionaries are stored compressed in dictionaries, the name-language-gender dictionary is divided in three files (d2_1, d2_2, d2_3).

The Jupyter notebook 'introduction to gender-it.ipynb' display an example of the use of the gender_it function over the sample 'name_country.csv' available in the example folder.
