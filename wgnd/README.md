# World Gender-Name Dictionary (WGND)

 The dictionary was created for our Working Paper NÂ°33: [Identifying the gender of PCT inventors](https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4125&plang=EN).

We believe the WGND is a valuable contribution to the gender studies community, although there is always room for further improvement. We intend to update the dictionary to increase even more its international coverage. 

The first challenge we faced in order to attribute gender was to get a gender-name dictionary with worldwide coverage. For this reason, we compiled 13 different sources of gender-name dictionaries, which combined, cover 173 different countries. 

Most of the sources used for this study come from national public institutions.
